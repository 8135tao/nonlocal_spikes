\begin{itemize}
\item [1)] systems, $u \in \R^n$ with assumptions similar to what is in the AMS Memoirs Radially symmetric.. 


\item [2)] $x \in \R^n$, reduce to model problem $\Delta u -u + u^2 =0$ rather than ODE
use again that reduced system has "ground state", localized solution, 
with linearization invertible


Reference: Uniqueness of Positive solutions of $\Delta u -u+u^p = 0$ in $\R^n$.

here I want to study scalar equations of the form 
$-u(x) + K\ast u(x) = f(u(x),\mu)$, in contrast to \ref{1dnl}, $x \in \R^n$ with $n>1$

\item [3)] combine both, $u \in \R^N, x \in \R^n$


\item [4)] $-u+ K*u + f_\mu(u)=0$
with K*u involving say the fractional Laplacian via, say
$\hat{K}= 1-|k|^{2 \alpha} + O(k^\beta)$
with beta large enough, alpha in $(0,1) (?)$
look at literature on ground stateas for fractional Laplacian...



Motivated by models for neural fields, we study the existence of pulses  bifurcating from a spatially homogeneous state in nonlocally coupled systems of equations. More specifically, we look at equations of the form $Au + K*u = N(u;\mu$, where $N$ encodes nonlinear terms, $A$ is an invertible matrix, and $K$ an even matrix convolution kernel. Assuming the presence of neutral modes, that is, solutions of the form $u\sim \exp(i \ell x)$ to the linear part, we show under appropriate assumptions on the nonlinearity and the unfolding in $\mu$ that pulses bifurcate. Such an anlysis is carried out using center manifold reduction, when coupling is local, say, $K=\delta''$. Here, we rely on functional analytic methods using predictors from formal expansions and correctors obtained after preconditioning the nonlinear system.
